This week for my reflection I reviewed the paper "Artificial Intelligence and Aesthetic Judgement" by Hullman, Holtzman, and Gelman. In this paper, the authors argue that people view their encounters with the outputs of generative AI models with the same kind of aesthetic judgements that they view artwork. They also discuss some of the pitfalls people experience in attempting to scrutinize what AI generated media means. One particularly interesting point they make early on in the paper is that "In judgements of both art and generative AI we see an urgency aroud how to make sense of developments in aesthetic production from a telological viewpoint that we hope will help us anticipate future developments in this fast-moving technology". I think this is interesting because it draws a parellel between AI-generated work and past technological advancements in artistic fields. They also say that by assuming that whatever we are seeking in media is lacking in AI generated media, analyzing what AI generated media is doing becomes self-defeating. The authors conclude by saying that we should expect the nature of our aesthetic judements to change with the technology, as this has always been the case in the history of art. They even compare the rush to philosophize generative AI to what occured during the Renaissance era, where there were so many innovations in art and how to spread ideas around the world. People's fear of AI and what it means for artists is causing them to want to "put them in their place" and define them distinctly from art, despite it being in our nature to apply the same aesthetic judgement that we do for art. This paper was far different than anything I have read for this class, or really ever. I found it really interesting as someone who is involved in the technical aspects of the rise in generative AI as a Data Science major to get a glimpse into the social and philosophical aspects of it. I beleive the authors are correct that we are entering into a new age that will change not just our relationship with technology in a practical way but also in a philosophical way.
