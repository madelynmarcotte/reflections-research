For this week I reviewed the paper "From Invisible to Visible: Impacts of Metadata in Communicative Data Visualization by Burns, Lee, On, Xiong, Peck, and Mahyar. I chose this paper from the inspo folder and thought the premise sounded interesting and distinct from the other papers I have been reflecting on, many of which aligned with specific interests of mine. This week I wanted to focus more on Data Vis itself and not just how it is applied to fields I frequently research, like healthcare and energy systems. The authors of this paper ran two experiments to assess the impact of metadata on data visualizations. The first experiment explored how the chart type, topic, and user goal impacted which categories of metadata participants deemed the most relevant. The second experiment explored how the different types of metadata impact transparency, trustworthiness, persuasiveness, information relevance, and understanding. The authors define metadata as "information that is not directly represented in a visualization which provides contextual information on the source of the data, the transformations applied to the data, the visualization elements, its purpose, the people involved in its creation, and its intended audience." The results of their experiments showed that visualizations with metadata were perceived as more thorough, but similarly accurate, clear, complete, and relevant in comparison to visualizations without metadata. They also found that the presence of metadata did not impact the correctness of descriptions given by participants, but may have impacted what they saw as important enough to mention. During the first experiment, they found that
