For this week's reflection I reviewed the paper titled "Building Bridges Between HCI Research in Latin American and in the Global North" by Pedro Reynolds-Cuellar, Marisol Wong-Villacres, Karla Badillo-Urquiola, Mayra Donaji Barrera Machuca, Franceli L. Cibrian, Marianela Ciolfi Felice, Carolina Fuentes, Laura Sanely Gaytan-Lugo, Vivian Genario Motti, Monica Perusqui-Hernandez, and Oscar A. Lemus. Based on the title alone this paper sounded very different from the ones I have been reviewing for this course, and thought it would be a good one to reflect on before our final class. In this paper the authors conducted a survey with 66 responses along with 19 in-depth interviews to address the gap in knowledge betwwen initiatives to increase the representation of HCI practictioners and the actual implementation. Through their analysis they sought to characterize a set of research perspectives on how HCI is practices in/about Latin America. In their background research they discuss the efforts that have been made to increase HCI representation in Latin America, but how despite that influential local HCI efforts in the region have had little to no international exposure, and that only between 0.5% and 1.2% of top HCI conference attendees are from Latin America. Without an understanding of HCI practices that are employed by practitioners in Latin America and the challenges they face, attempts to make LATAM-originated knowledge more salient for HCI research globally are hindered. The three research questions they ask are "How is HCI practices in LATAM", "What factors influence HCI practices in LATAM?" and "What challenges do HCI practitioners encounter in this context?" In the results of their surveys, they found that of the respondents who do research, 47% of them cite interpersonal challenges, 25% cite resource scarcity, 6% cite discriminatory technology, 6% cite publishing fees, 7% cite language, 30% cite adaptation of methods to LATAM, and 14% cite the multidisciplinary context of HCI. Following their analysis of their semi-structured interview results, the authors said "Our data indicate that driven by a complicated relation with LATAM's historical inequities, the Latin American HCI diaspora, the industry, and academia, participants emphasize technology design and research aimed at supporting social transformations. Such an emphasis, however, is hard to pursue, it lies in stark contrast with existing academic and economic structures in LATAM and beyond, while demanding the mastering of skills that the region's infrastructures do not fully support. Through their analysis they also found that the researchers from LATAM that they surveyed and interviewed were strongly supported by relational factors such as diasporic relationships or local community connections. They found that the participants they worked with also have a strong sense of social responsibility regarding the way they think and approach their HCI practice informed by lived experiences. The authors argue that this knowledge can be used to build foundations and forge less colonial relationships with HCI cites in the Global North and to avoid perpetuating the existence of research silos and power imbalances.
